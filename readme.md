# UFO_Study
## Intro

This project is an update of my UFO command line project which I built about 8
months ago. That project was a good way to learn how to start to use Pandas and
numpy. However, with the project being command line it really was hard to use and
kind of 'clunky'. With this project, I will be able to better present the data and
let the user have a much better experience with it.

The data from this project comes from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/master/data/ufo.csv
I took the data from that site and placed it into a csv file to use with this
project.
